# I have no name for this. This is just an example of creating something in Unreal Engine 5.

## Idea: third-person shooter. Maybe a survival. I would like to add some NPC (zombies?), a multiplier support. 

### Preview:

1. [Start. Implemented some animations, weapon, recoil, etc.](https://youtu.be/bdR10srSX4Q?si=ct64iz-LjiRu7IUA)
2. [Hint component added. A few new animations with weapons.](https://youtu.be/O--caZiBUno)
